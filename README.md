### Hello سڵاو مرحبا Merhaba! 

💥Who am I?

   - 👩🏽‍💻Raz here! I like languages 🧠+ flying ✈️. I am a software developer with lots of energy to ✨beautify✨ already beautiful backends.

💥What kinda techs do I like?

   - I LOVE GOLANG! Fiber is by far my favorite framework to work with. Ideally I'd be building my backends with Golang and frontend with React⚛️.
   - I also have experience in Ruby on Rails 💎 + mobile development 📱.

💥What am I busy with right now?

   - Currently working on building my personal portfolio using React.js ⚛️ with a Golang backend (mostly seeded data storage)! My newest bebe is my meditation app
   - Pema is my multilingual meditation app. It is a mobile app with authentication on the backend + React Native on the frontend.
   - I am also JOB SEARCHING! which has been hard, kind of like the meme "I need experience to get a job. -But I also need a job to get experience!"
