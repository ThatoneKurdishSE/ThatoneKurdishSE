### Hello سڵاو مرحبا Merhaba! 

💥  Who am I?

   - 👩🏽‍💻Raz here! I like languages 🧠 + flying ✈️ . I am a software developer who wants to ✨ beautify ✨ apps. 

💥  What kinda techs do I like?

   - I LOVE GOLANG! Fiber is by far my favorite framework to work with. Ideally I'd be building my backends with Golang and frontend with React.js ⚛️.
   - I also have experience in Ruby on Rails 💎 + mobile development 📱.

💥  What am I busy with right now?

   - Currently working on building my personal portfolio using React.js ⚛️! My newest bebe 🐣 is my meditation app, 🧘🏽‍♂️ Pema is my multilingual meditation app. It is a mobile app 📱 with RoR ⛔️ authentication on the backend + React Native on the frontend.
